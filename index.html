        <h2>Our Love Story</h2>

        <div class="story-section">
            <p>It all started on <span class="highlight">July 20th, 2024</span>, when I randomly messaged her "Hi" on Instagram. To my surprise, she replied within hours. I was shocked, excited, and completely nervous. She was my crush, someone I had noticed before but never had the courage to approach. I first saw her sister, who looked quite similar, at my cousin's wedding. But later, I found out she had a younger sister, the one who had captured my heart.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <p>We had crossed paths on a religious trip, and though I noticed her, I never dared to talk to her. And now, here she was, replying to my message. It took me two whole days to gather the courage to respond again. When I asked how she was, she casually replied, "Fine, what about you?" I nervously said, "Mast," and our conversation slowly began.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <p>As we kept chatting day and night, we got to know each other better. Both of us were from <span class="highlight">Bhavnagar, Gujarat</span>, from the same caste, and even lived in the same area! Coincidentally, she was moving to a new address – right opposite my home where my parents lived.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <p>Eventually, I convinced her to switch to iMessage, and that’s when she gave me her number. Three days later, out of the blue, she called me while I was busy with household chores. That first call lasted two hours, and from there, our chats grew longer into the night.</p>
